# [Vanaheim](https://github.com/speredenn/vanaheim)

Vanaheim is my blog engine based on bottle. I wanted to write my own engine, as simple, and as functional as I wanted it to be. It is heavily inspired by [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto), [hobo](https://github.com/andrewnelder/hobo), and [bobe](https://github.com/Matael/bottle-blog-engine).

## Requirements

  - [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/stable/)
  - [python-markdown](http://packages.python.org/Markdown/)
