# [Vanaheim](https://github.com/speredenn/vanaheim)

Vanaheim is my website engine based on
[Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/stable/). It is basically a blog
engine with extra functions to serve static files (downloads), special
pages, like slides in HTML5. I wanted to write my own engine, as
simple, and as functional as I wanted it to be. It has been heavily
inspired by [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto),
[hobo](https://github.com/andrewnelder/hobo), and
[bobe](https://github.com/Matael/bottle-blog-engine).

## Requirements

  - [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/stable/)
  - [python-markdown](http://packages.python.org/Markdown/)
